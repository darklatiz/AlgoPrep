# How to Sum

Write a function "howToSum(targetSum , numbers)" that takes in

```
    - a target sum
    - an array of numbers
```

The function should return an array containing any combination of elements that add up
to exactly the targetSum. If there is no combination that adds up to the targetSum then
return <b>null</b>

If there are multiple combinations possible, you may return any single one.
