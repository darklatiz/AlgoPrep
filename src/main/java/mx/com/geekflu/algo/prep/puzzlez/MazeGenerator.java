/**
 * Implement the maze as a two-dimensional array of integers. 
 * If the value of an element is 1, it is a wall. If the value is 0, it is a pass.
 * 1. There should be walls around the maze, with the exception of two cells - entrance and exit.
 * 
 * 2. Any empty cell must be accessible from the entrance or exit of the maze. 
 * It is not possible to walk along the maze diagonally, only vertically and horizontally.
 * 
 * 3. There's got to be a path from the entrance to the exit. 
 * It doesn't matter what is considered an entrance and what is an exit as they are interchangeable.
 * 
 * To print the array, follow these two rules:
 * to display a pass, use two space characters
 * to display a wall, use two block characters in a row (the same): â–ˆ (U+2588). 
 * You can print the wall like this: System.out.print("\u2588\u2588").
 * Remember that the maze is only visible if you have a monospace font! Otherwise, 
 * the space symbol will be quite small in width. 
 * At this stage, it does not matter which maze you display. 
 * The program may always output the same prepared maze or one of a set of prepared mazes.
